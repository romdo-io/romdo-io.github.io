P.S. Sidequests is a new concept we're trying out where we focus on a single topic. It's a kind of spin-off of the "What are we playing?" segment from our regular episodes. The idea is to do very little editing to Sidequests to keep publish time to a minimum. So if you find the editing/audio quality lower than usual, there's a reason for it. If you have any thoughts and/or complaints, we'd love to hear it :)
