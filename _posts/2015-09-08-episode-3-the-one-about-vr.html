P.S. Due to summer holiday trips, and otherwise heat-induced chaos, this episode is published just over a month after it we recorded it. With summer heat strokes and obligatory "zomg its hot must have holiday kthxbye" craziness out of the way, new episodes should come on a more regular basis in the future :)
