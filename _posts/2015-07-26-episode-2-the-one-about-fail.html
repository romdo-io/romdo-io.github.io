P.S. Our original recording for this episode was just under 2 hours long. So in an effort spare our listeners from extended brain damage, a lot of rambling (mostly by Jim) was cut short, or cut out completely to get a more concise and on-topic episode. And in the spirit of embracing FAIL, we've left remarks about recording length that don't make sense as a lot of rambling was cut out.<br />
